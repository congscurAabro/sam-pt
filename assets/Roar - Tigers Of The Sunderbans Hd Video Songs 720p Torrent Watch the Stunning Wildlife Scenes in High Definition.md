ROAR: Tigers of the Sundarbans (2014) is a Hindi-language film directed by Kamal Sadanah, which tells the story of a team of commandos who enter the dangerous forest of the Sundarbans to hunt down a white tigress that killed one of their members. The film was premiered by Salman Khan in Mumbai on 31 July 2014 and released on 31 October 2014.
  
The film begins with Uday, a young photojournalist who is on an assignment in the Sundarbans, a vast mangrove forest that spans India and Bangladesh. He rescues a white tiger cub from a poacher's trap and brings it to his base camp in a nearby village. However, this causes panic among the villagers, who fear the wrath of the mother tigress. The forest warden takes the cub away to calm the situation, but it is too late. The tigress tracks down Uday's hut by following the scent of her cub's blood and kills him in revenge. She then drags his body into the forest and disappears.

Uday's brother, Pundit, is the captain of an elite commando team. He arrives at the Sundarbans to claim his brother's body and seek justice. He is met with silence and hostility from the villagers and the forest warden, who refuses to help him recover his brother's body or capture the tigress, citing the complexity and danger of the forest ecology. Pundit decides to take matters into his own hands and calls his commando team for backup. He also hires a local guide named Madhu and a tracker named Jhumpa to assist him in his mission.
  
The team ventures into the core area of the forest, where they face various challenges and threats from the wildlife and the environment. They soon realize that they are dealing with a smart and cunning tigress, who not only evades them at every turn but also lures them into her territory. Meanwhile, a ruthless poacher named Bheera sees an opportunity to profit from the situation. He plans to use Pundit's team as bait to trap and kill the rare white tigress for his own gain. The hunters become the hunted as they are caught in a deadly game of survival between man and beast.
  
The film features stunning shots of the natural beauty of the Sundarbans and over 800 shots with special effects. It also showcases the animal-man conflict and the importance of conservation. The film has an international crew of 150 members and a 300-member VFX team. It took 12 months to edit the film and put it on screen.
