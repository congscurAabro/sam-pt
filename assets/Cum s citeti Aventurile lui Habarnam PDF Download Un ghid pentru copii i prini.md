But who are the characters that you will meet in *Aventurile lui Habarnam*? Let's take a look at some of them:

- **Habarnam**: He is the main character and the narrator of the book. His name means "Don't Know" in Romanian, because he is always curious and asking questions, but he also doesn't know many things and makes mistakes. He is very friendly, cheerful, and adventurous, but sometimes he can be naughty, lazy, or careless. He loves to invent new things, such as a flying machine or a musical instrument, but they often don't work as expected. He also likes to play pranks on his friends, such as painting their faces or hiding their things.
- **Gogo**: He is Habarnam's best friend and his partner in crime. His name means "Go Go" in Romanian, because he is always ready to go anywhere and do anything with Habarnam. He is very loyal, brave, and fun-loving, but sometimes he can be impulsive, reckless, or stubborn. He likes to explore new places, such as the Moon or the Land of Giants, but he also gets into trouble sometimes because of his curiosity or disobedience.
- **Snufi**: He is another friend of Habarnam and Gogo. His name means "Sniff" in Romanian, because he has a very good sense of smell and can find anything by sniffing. He is very smart, helpful, and polite, but sometimes he can be shy, timid, or nervous. He likes to read books, solve puzzles, and learn new things, but he also gets scared easily by loud noises or scary creatures.
- **Doctorel**: He is the doctor of the Flower Town and a friend of Habarnam and his friends. His name means "Little Doctor" in Romanian, because he is very knowledgeable and skilled in medicine and science. He is very kind, generous, and patient, but sometimes he can be serious, strict, or boring. He likes to heal the sick, conduct experiments, and teach the gnomes about health and hygiene, but he also gets annoyed sometimes by Habarnam's mischief or ignorance.

These are just some of the characters that you will encounter in *Aventurile lui Habarnam*.
