# Infaq Fi Sabilillah: The Islamic Way of Spending in the Cause of Allah
 
Infaq fi sabilillah is an Arabic term that means spending in the way of Allah. It is an important institution of Islam that encourages Muslims to use their wealth for the benefit of others and for the sake of Allah. Allah the Almighty has stressed on such kind of spending in many places of the Holy Quran. Moreover, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his companions always practiced the teaching about such spending through their sayings and actions.
 
Spending in the way of Allah can take various forms, such as giving zakat (obligatory charity), sadaqah (voluntary charity), waqf (endowment), qard hasan (benevolent loan), or supporting any good cause that serves Islam and humanity. Spending in the way of Allah can also be done with one's time, effort, knowledge, or skills. The benefits of spending in the way of Allah are manifold, both in this world and in the hereafter. Allah promises to reward those who spend in His cause with His mercy, forgiveness, blessings, and paradise.

How can we spend in the way of Allah? There are many ways and opportunities to do so, depending on our intention, ability, and situation. Here are some suggestions:

1. Pay your zakat on time and in full. Zakat is one of the five pillars of Islam and a compulsory duty for every eligible Muslim. It is a fixed percentage of one's wealth that must be given annually to the poor and needy. Zakat purifies one's wealth, soul, and society. It also fosters brotherhood, solidarity, and justice among Muslims.
2. Give sadaqah generously and regularly. Sadaqah is any voluntary charity that is given out of compassion, love, friendship, or generosity. It can be given in any form, such as money, food, clothes, or even a smile or a good word. Sadaqah has many benefits, such as increasing one's wealth, expiating one's sins, protecting one from calamities, and bringing one closer to Allah.
3. Establish or support a waqf. Waqf is a permanent endowment of property or money for a charitable or religious purpose. It is a noble way of spending in the way of Allah that has a lasting impact and reward. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "When a person dies, all his deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (waqf), beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him." (Muslim)
4. Offer a qard hasan. Qard hasan is a benevolent loan that is given without interest or any other benefit. It is a form of sadaqah that helps the borrower in his time of need and eases his burden. Allah says: "Whoever gives a good loan to Allah, He will multiply it for him manifold, and he will have a noble reward." (al-Hadid 57: 11)
5. Support any good cause that serves Islam and humanity. There are many causes that need our support and contribution, such as building mosques, schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc., or supporting dawah, education, relief, development, etc. We should choose the causes that are most appealing and suitable to us and donate our money, time, effort, knowledge, or skills to them.

Whatever we give or spend in the way of Allah will be returned to us in manifold increase. Allah, the most Bountiful and the most Loving, commends: "Lend unto God a goodly loan. Whatever good you shall forward on your behalf you shall find it with God, as better and richer in reward." (al-Muzzammil 73: 20)
