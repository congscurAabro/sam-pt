Graph Mode is ideal for users who want to fine-tune every aspect of their vocal performance. Users can draw in pitch curves, adjust timing, create vibrato, and manipulate formants with precision and accuracy. Graph Mode also supports Audio Random Access (ARA) technology, which enables seamless integration with compatible DAWs such as Studio One and Logic Pro X.
 
Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 also comes with a new plugin called Auto-Key, which automatically detects the key and scale of any music and sends that information to Auto-Tune Pro or any other Antares plugin. This saves time and ensures accuracy when working with multiple tracks or different songs.
 
Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 is the most complete and advanced edition of Auto-Tune ever released. It is the professional standard for pitch correction and vocal effects, and the tool of choice for the most iconic vocal sound in popular music.[^1^] [^2^]
  
In this article, we will explore some of the key features of Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 and how they can enhance your vocal production and creativity.
 
## Auto-Key: Automatic Key and Scale Detection
 
One of the new features of Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 is Auto-Key, a plugin that automatically detects the key and scale of any music and sends that information to Auto-Tune Pro or any other Antares plugin. This saves time and ensures accuracy when working with multiple tracks or different songs. Auto-Key can also suggest the optimal key for your song based on the vocal range of your singer. You can also manually set the key and scale if you prefer.[^1^] [^2^]
 
## Classic Mode: The Legendary Auto-Tune 5 Sound
 
Another new feature of Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 is Classic Mode, which emulates the sound of the original Auto-Tune 5 plugin that was used on countless hit records. Classic Mode has a slightly different algorithm than the modern Auto-Tune mode, resulting in a tighter and more transparent pitch correction. Classic Mode is ideal for users who want to achieve the iconic vocal sound of artists like T-Pain, Kanye West, Cher, and many more.[^1^] [^3^]

## Real-Time MIDI Control: Dynamic Pitch and Parameter Adjustment
 
Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 also supports real-time MIDI control, allowing users to adjust pitch and other parameters with a MIDI keyboard or controller. This enables users to create expressive and dynamic vocal performances with Auto-Tune Pro in real time. Users can assign MIDI notes to specific pitches, scales, or bypass functions, as well as MIDI CCs to retune speed, humanize, formant, throat length, and more. Real-time MIDI control can also be used to create pitch bends, vibrato, and other effects.[^1^] [^4^]
 
## ARA Support: Seamless Integration with Compatible DAWs
 
Another feature of Auto-Tune Pro v9.1.0 is Audio Random Access (ARA) technology, which enables seamless integration with compatible DAWs such as Studio One and Logic Pro X. ARA allows Auto-Tune Pro to access the audio data directly from the DAW, without requiring any audio rendering or file transfers. This means that users can edit pitch and time in Graph Mode without leaving their DAW environment. ARA also allows users to sync their DAW timeline with Auto-Tune Pro's timeline, making it easier to navigate and edit large projects.[^1^] [^5^]
