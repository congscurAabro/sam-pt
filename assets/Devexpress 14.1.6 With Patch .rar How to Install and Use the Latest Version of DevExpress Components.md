If you want to download and install Devexpress 14.1.6 with patch, you will need a .rar file that contains the setup files and the patch tool. A .rar file is a compressed archive that can be extracted using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
There are many sources on the internet that claim to offer Devexpress 14.1.6 with patch .rar, but some of them may be unreliable or unsafe. Therefore, you should be careful when choosing where to download the file from.
 
One possible source is [this website](https://barbbeaumier111zqa.wixsite.com/payroadeata/post/devexpress-14-1-6-with-patch-rar), which provides a direct link to download the file[^1^]. Another possible source is [this website](https://devexpress-1416-with-patch-rar.peatix.com/), which requires you to register and join an event before downloading the file[^2^]. A third possible source is [this website](https://compnaregfe1989.wixsite.com/chatwavingga/post/devexpress-14-1-6-with-patch-rar-exclusive), which provides a detailed description of how to use the patch tool[^3^]. However, these sources are not verified or endorsed by Devexpress or me, so you should use them at your own risk.
 
Once you have downloaded the Devexpress 14.1.6 with patch .rar file, you will need to extract it to a folder on your computer. Then, you will need to run the setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install Devexpress 14.1.6 on your computer.
 
After the installation is complete, you will need to run the DevExpress.Patch 7.0-by dimaster tool, which is included in the .rar file. This tool will allow you to register Devexpress 14.1.6 and unlock all its features.
 
To use the patch tool, you will need to select the Devexpress products that you want to register from the list, and then click on the Patch button. If you have previously installed an older version of Devexpress, you may need to uninstall it and use the Uninstall Patch button before applying the new patch[^4^].
 
After applying the patch, you should be able to use Devexpress 14.1.6 without any limitations or restrictions.
